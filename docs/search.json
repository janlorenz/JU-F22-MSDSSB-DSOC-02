Test your line by sending it to the Console (with Ctrl + Enter). Once you are satisfied, render the document, commit the changes with message “First Visualization!” and push it. In the following, you can commit and push when you want. (Note, that we can provide help directly in your repo when you commit and push before.) This is the template.\n\nggplot(data = __________, mapping = aes(x = ________)) + \n  geom_TOSELECT()\n\nNow, we want to know the distribution of values of the numerical variable distance in flights. A common visualization is a histogram. Use geom-histogram with the same template, write the solution in the chunk flightsdistance, and test it. Notice, the red comment in the console. It advises to specify a binwidth. Test binwidth = 5, binwidth = 50, and binwidth = 500 in geom_histogram, notice the difference (consult ?geom_histogram) for details, and decide which shows the distribution best.\nIn chunk distributions you see two ways to visualize the distribution of the number of seats in airplanes - points for each observation and a boxplot. (Read ?geom_boxplot for more information). Note, that there are three ggplot objects (g1, g2, g3) which are shown combined with g1 + g2 + g3 (using the patchwork package). Make the empty g3 into a vertical histogram for the same data following the exercise before. Hint: For the vertical histogram assign distance to the y aesthetic and leave out the x aesthetic. Think about the advantages and disadvantages of each visualization.\nNow, we make the first plot which visualizes two variables, the categorical variable engine, and the numerical variable seats in airplanes. Use the template and with aesthetics x and y and the geom_boxplot and put the solution into the chunk engine-seats\nTwo numerical variables can be visualized with a scatter plot using geom_point and the aesthetics x and y. Let us look at dep_delay and arr_delay of flights. Warning: The flights is very large! So, do not use flights in data = _____ but a random sample of 10,000 flights sample_n(flights, 10000). Now, let us add information about the categorical variable origin and assign it to the color aesthetic. Put your solution into the chunk delays. Test your solution several times and observe the changes in the visualization because of the random sampling. In which region are the changes most substantial? (This is a qualitative judgment.)\nFinally, let us visualize the location of airports as points at their longitude and latitude (look up the variable names) and color them with the timezone tzone they are in. Put the solution into the chunk airportlocations."

    "text": "1.3 Data wrangling, pipes, and visualization\nIn the following, you have to solve some data wrangling tasks. For data wrangling, the usage of the pipe, or a chain of pipes, is convenient. You can also use the pipe to finish with a visualization.\n\nPut the code snippet below into the chunk flightsaveragespeed and test it. The mutate line makes a new variable called speed which is the distance of the flight divided by the time in the air. The select line selects variables from the dataset. In this case, it selects air_time as the first, distance as the second, and the new speed as the third variable. All other variables are dropped.\nThe values in the new speed variable do not look like speeds of airplanes in km/h. Why? Because they are in miles/minute which we know from the variable descriptions. Modify the equation in the mutate command such that the values are in km/h. To that end, you have to divide air time by 60 and multiply distance by a certain factor. Look up the factor. Be careful with the order of mathematical operations and maybe use brackets (). Test your computation. Are the speed values reasonable?\nNow, make a histogram of speed. Add another pipe after the select statement and write ggplot(mapping = aes()) in the next line. Note, that you should not put data = flights into the argument of ggplot()! It is the mission of the pipe to do this. Fill out the aes() command accordingly, and add the geom for a histogram.\n\nflights |> \n  mutate(speed = distance / air_time ) |> \n  select(air_time, distance, speed)\n\nPractice filter operations, which subsets certain observations of a dataframe. Write a line which filters the flights which\n\n\nhad an arrival delay of two or more hours\nflew to Houston (IAH or HOU)\narrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late\nstarted with a delay of at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight. Put all four lines into the chunk filtering.\n\n\nAnother common operation is summarizing data. Put the code below into the chunk summarizing and test it. You see the average delay at departure. (See ?mean to learn what na.rm = TRUE is doing). Now, we want to know the average delay at departue for each of the three airports of origin. This is done with a group_by applied to the flights. Find out how and modify the code in the chunk accordingly.\n\nflights |> \n  summarize(mean_dep_deplay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nFinally, look at the plot of airportlocations. The airport locations show the shape of the United States of America, but there are four airports on the right hand side which do not fit that pattern. Filter airports such that you only see these four airport. Write your solution into the chunk stangeairportlocations. Check with internet research where these airports are located. Why are the locations from the data as they are? List your hypotheses for each airport under the chunk."

    "text": "Read and do the homework in R first. There you find more instructions and exercises.\nYou can also copy each chunk into a notebook cell within jupyter notebook template file and work with the .ipynb file\nquarto can also render .ipynb files. (Actually quarto converts .qmd files into .ipynb files and renders them afterwards)\nThere is also a .ipynb Template in the python Codebase provided.\n\nThis analysis works with datasets in the package nycflights13 about flights, specifically a sample of domestic flights that departed from the three major New York City airport in 2013.\n\n1 Data overview\n#| label: packages-data\n#| message: false  # We do not want to see the common tidyverse message in our document\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom nycflights13 import flights, planes,airports\nRun the first chunk to import the packages, by running the command as:\n\nfrom nycflights import …\n\nYou can deliberately choose which dataset you want to import from nycflights13. The nameing convension seems to be identical with the dataset in R.\n#| output: false\nflights.info()\nExplore the datasets. If you are running the code in VSCode you can see the variable in the “JUPYTER: VARIABLES” window. Write flights.info() in the Console or in a chunk and remove it afterwards to see an overview of all variables, their types. (Write a short note about the differences to the R glimpse command)\n\n\n2 Whats the differences between R:glimpse and pandas:info\n…\n\n\n3 Data visualization\n\nWe first want to know the distribution of values of the categorical variable origin in flights. To that end, make a bar chart. Use the seaborn command displot.\n\n\nsns.displot(data=flights,x = .. y= ..,height=.., aspect=..)\ngeom_bar or geom_col is just a variation between the usage of variable x and y. Use height=.., aspect=.. to adjust the size of the plot.\n\nNow, we want to know the distribution of values of the numerical variable distance in flights. A common visualization is a histogram. Use sns.histplot with the same template, write the solution in the chunk flightsdistance, and test it. The command binwidth is equivalent to bin-width in R. Use it inside the seaborn function.\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,6)) is used to vary the size of the plot.\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,6))\nsns.histplot(data=flights,x='distance',ax=ax, ...)\nIn chunk distributions you see two ways to visualize the distribution of the number of seats in airplanes - points for each observation and a boxplot. Different to ggplot you define the output first. With ncols= .. ,nrows =.. you specify the layout and access it with  ax  similar to an array.\n#| label: distributions\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=3,figsize=(8,6))\n#fig,[ax1,ax2,ax3] = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=3,figsize=(24,12)) ## Or define the array elements\nax[0].plot(np.zeros(len(planes)),planes['seats'],'k.')\nsns.boxplot(data=planes,y='seats',\n    boxprops={'facecolor':'None'},\n    ax=ax[1])\n#sns.boxplot(data=planes\n    #boxprops={'facecolor':'None'},\n    #ax=..)\n    # )\nNow, we make the first plot in python which visualizes two variables, the categorical variable engine, and the numerical variable seats in airplanes\n#| label: engine-seats\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(24,12))\n\nsns.boxplot(data=planes,x = .. , y = ..\n    boxprops={'facecolor':'None'},\n    ax=ax)\nSo, do not use flights in data = .. but a random sample of 10,000 flights flights.sample(n=10000). To visualize a scatterplot use sns.scatterplot(). To add an information about the categorical variable origin and assign it to the color aesthetica variation, include  ..,hue= .. , in the scatterplot command.\n#| label: delays\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,10))\nsns.scatterplot(data= flights.., x='dep_delay',y='arr_delay',..,ax=ax)\nFinally, let us visualize the location of airports as points at their longitude and latitude (look up the variable names) and color them with the timezone tzone they are in. Put the solution into the chunk airportlocations.\n#| label: airportlocations\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,10))\nsns.scatterplot()\n\n\n4 Data Wrangling\nIn the following, you have to solve some data wrangling tasks. For data wrangling, you use different commands onto a DataFrame devided by a “.” . There is not equivalent to “pipes” in the pandas or python programming language. Here the easiest way is to creat a new column in our DataFrame with the average speed in it. The pandas specific .div() command allows for a fast division of two columns. Also modify the equation such that the values are in km/h.\n#| label: flightsaveragespeed\nflights['speed'] = flights['distance'].div(flights['air_time'])\nThe filter function is not available in python. IMHO the .loc function is the most comprehensive function the filter a DataFrame by using logical expressions.\nPractice .loc operations, which subsets certain observations of a dataframe. Write a line which filters the flights which\n\nhad an arrival delay of two or more hours\nflew to Houston (IAH or HOU)\narrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late\nstarted with a delay of at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight.\n\nuse individual lines for each filter. In the end use .describe() on the flights DataFrame. Now, we want to know the average delay at departue for each of the three airports of origin. This is done with a groupby(..) applied to the filtered DataFrame. additionally apply mean() and select the correct column. Find out how and modify the code in the chunk accordingly.\n#| label: flightsaveragespeed\nflights = flights.loc[flights['arr_delay']>=120] # 120 minutes\nNOTE: If you do not choose a new variable name for the DataFrame, data is lost, until you reload the complete DataFrame\nFinally, look at the plot of airportlocations. The airport locations show the shape of the United States of America, but there are four airports on the right hand side which do not fit that pattern. Filter airports such that you only see these four airport. Write your solution into the chunk stangeairportlocations. Check with internet research where these airports are located. Why are the locations from the data as they are? List your hypotheses for each airport under the chunk.\n#| label: strangeairportlocations\nplt.figure(figsize=(20,6))\nplt.plot( airports[..],airports[..] ,'.')"
