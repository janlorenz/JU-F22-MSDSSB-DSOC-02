Authenticate git to access your GitHub content\nBefore you can clone your repository you need to tell GitHub that you are authorized to do this, and to that end you need to make a Personal Access Token (PAT) in your GitHub account and make this available to git and RStudio on your local machine.\nThere are several ways to do this (e.g.¬†from the command line) but as we will use RStudio anyway, we can use a convenient way provided there.\nRead more about PATs and how to use them in ‚ÄúHappy Git with R‚Äù Chapter 9 https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html (in particular the TL;DR which describes what we use).\nOpen RStudio and install the packages usethis and gitcreds if you haven‚Äôt done already: Go to the ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù pane at the bottom left. Type in\ninstall.packages(c(\"usethis\",\"gitcreds\"))\nand hit Enter. Now the packages should be installed.\nNow, use two commands. Copy them to the console and click Enter:\nusethis::create_github_token()\nThis opens http://github.com and you may need to log in. Then you can make the PAT (read more details in ‚ÄúHappy Git with R‚Äù). For today, you can go the fast way and do not think about the options and click ‚ÄúGenerate token‚Äù. Use the clipboard icon üìã to copy the PAT. Go back to RStudio and do in the console:\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\nIn the dialog in the console paste your PAT from the clipboard and press Enter. That should be it and you do not need to repeat these steps until the PAT expires. (If the PAT expires you have to make a new one in the same way.)"

Read the Help ?geom_bar and decide if you need to use geom_bar or geom_col. You can use the template below. Write your solution in the chunk flightsorigin. Test your line by sending it the Console (with Ctrl + Enter). Once you are satisfied, render the document, commit the changes with message ‚ÄúFirst Visualization!‚Äù and push it. In the following, you can commit and push when you want. (Note, that we can provide help directly in your repo when you commit and push before.) This is the template.\n\nggplot(data = __________, mapping = aes(x = ________) + \n  geom_TOSELECT()\n\nNow, we want to know the distribution of values of the numerical variable distance in flights. A common visualization is a histogram. Use geom-histogram with the same template, write the solution in the chunk flightsdistance, and test it. Notice, the red comment in the console. It advises to specify a binwidth. Test bin-width = 5, bin-width = 50, and bin-width = 500 in geom_histogram, notice the difference (consult ?geom_histogram) for details, and decide which shows the distribution best.\nIn chunk distributions you see two ways to visualize the distribution of the number of seats in airplanes - points for each observation and a boxplot. (Read ?geom_boxplot for more information). Note, that there are three ggplot objects (g1, g2, g3) which are shown combined with g1 + g2 + g3 (using the patchwork package). Make the empty g3 into a vertical histogram for the same data following the exercise before. Hint: For the vertical histogram assign distance to the y aesthetic and leave out the x aesthetic. Think about the advantages and disadvantages of each visualization.\nNow, we make the first plot which visualizes two variables, the categorical variable engine, and the numerical variable seats in airplanes. Use the template and with aesthetics x and y and the geom_boxplot and put the solution into the chunk engine-seats\nTwo numerical variables can be visualized with a scatter plot using geom_point and the aesthetics x and y. Let us look at dep_delay and arr_delay of flights. Warning: The flights is very large! So, do not use flights in data = _____ but a random sample of 10,000 flights sample_n(flights, 10000). Now, let us add information about the categorical variable origin and assign it to the color aesthetic. Put your solution into the chunk delays. Test your solution several times and observe the changes in the visualization because of the random sampling. In which region are the changes most substantial? (This is a qualitative judgment.)\nFinally, let us visualize the location of airports as points at their longitude and latitude (look up the variable names) and color them with the timezone tzone they are in. Put the solution into the chunk airportlocations."

    "text": "1.3 Data wrangling, pipes, and visualization\nIn the following, you have to solve some data wrangling tasks. For data wrangling, the usage of the pipe, or a chain of pipes, is convenient. You can also use the pipe to finish with a visualization.\n\nPut the code snippet below into the chunk flightsaveragespeed and test it. The mutate line makes a new variable called speed which is the distance of the flight divided by the time in the air. The select line selects variables from the dataset. In this case, it selects air_time as the first, distance as the second, and the new speed as the third variable. All other variables are dropped.\nThe values in the new speed variable do not look like speeds of airplanes in km/h. Why? Because they are in miles/minute which we know from the variable descriptions. Modify the equation in the mutate command such that the values are in km/h. To that end, you have to divide air time by 60 and multiply distance by a certain factor. Look up the factor. Be careful with the order of mathematical operations and maybe use brackets (). Test your computation. Are the speed values reasonable?\nNow, make a histogram of speed. Add another pipe after the select statement and write ggplot(mapping = aes()) in the next line. Note, that you should not put data = flights into the argument of ggplot()! It is the mission of the pipe to do this. Fill out the aes() command accordingly, and add the geom for a histogram.\n\nflights |> \n  mutate(speed = distance / air_time ) |> \n  select(air_time, distance, speed)\n\nPractice filter operations, which subsets certain observations of a dataframe. Write a line which filters the flights which\n\n\nhad an arrival delay of two or more hours\nflew to Houston (IAH or HOU)\narrived more than two hours late, but didn‚Äôt leave late\nstarted with a delay of at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight. Put all four lines into the chunk filtering.\n\n\nAnother common operation is summarizing data. Put the code below into the chunk summarizing and test it. You see the average delay at departure. (See ?mean to learn what na.rm = TRUE is doing). Now, we want to know the average delay at departue for each of the three airports of origin. This is done with a group_by applied to the flights. Find out how and modify the code in the chunk accordingly.\n\nflights |> \n  summarize(mean_dep_deplay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nFinally, look at the plot of airportlocations. The airport locations show the shape of the United States of America, but there are four airports on the right hand side which do not fit that pattern. Filter airports such that you only see these four airport. Write your solution into the chunk stangeairportlocations. Check with internet research where these airports are located. Why are the locations from the data as they are? List your hypotheses for each airport under the chunk."
