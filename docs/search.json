Test your line by sending it to the Console (with Ctrl + Enter). Once you are satisfied, render the document, commit the changes with message “First Visualization!” and push it. In the following, you can commit and push when you want. (Note, that we can provide help directly in your repo when you commit and push before.) This is the template.\n\nggplot(data = __________, mapping = aes(x = ________)) + \n  geom_TOSELECT()\n\nNow, we want to know the distribution of values of the numerical variable distance in flights. A common visualization is a histogram. Use geom-histogram with the same template, write the solution in the chunk flightsdistance, and test it. Notice, the red comment in the console. It advises to specify a binwidth. Test binwidth = 5, binwidth = 50, and binwidth = 500 in geom_histogram, notice the difference (consult ?geom_histogram) for details, and decide which shows the distribution best.\nIn chunk distributions you see two ways to visualize the distribution of the number of seats in airplanes - points for each observation and a boxplot. (Read ?geom_boxplot for more information). Note, that there are three ggplot objects (g1, g2, g3) which are shown combined with g1 + g2 + g3 (using the patchwork package). Make the empty g3 into a vertical histogram for the same data following the exercise before. Hint: For the vertical histogram assign distance to the y aesthetic and leave out the x aesthetic. Think about the advantages and disadvantages of each visualization.\nNow, we make the first plot which visualizes two variables, the categorical variable engine, and the numerical variable seats in airplanes. Use the template and with aesthetics x and y and the geom_boxplot and put the solution into the chunk engine-seats\nTwo numerical variables can be visualized with a scatter plot using geom_point and the aesthetics x and y. Let us look at dep_delay and arr_delay of flights. Warning: The flights is very large! So, do not use flights in data = _____ but a random sample of 10,000 flights sample_n(flights, 10000). Now, let us add information about the categorical variable origin and assign it to the color aesthetic. Put your solution into the chunk delays. Test your solution several times and observe the changes in the visualization because of the random sampling. In which region are the changes most substantial? (This is a qualitative judgment.)\nFinally, let us visualize the location of airports as points at their longitude and latitude (look up the variable names) and color them with the timezone tzone they are in. Put the solution into the chunk airportlocations."

    "text": "1.3 Data wrangling, pipes, and visualization\nIn the following, you have to solve some data wrangling tasks. For data wrangling, the usage of the pipe, or a chain of pipes, is convenient. You can also use the pipe to finish with a visualization.\n\nPut the code snippet below into the chunk flightsaveragespeed and test it. The mutate line makes a new variable called speed which is the distance of the flight divided by the time in the air. The select line selects variables from the dataset. In this case, it selects air_time as the first, distance as the second, and the new speed as the third variable. All other variables are dropped.\nThe values in the new speed variable do not look like speeds of airplanes in km/h. Why? Because they are in miles/minute which we know from the variable descriptions. Modify the equation in the mutate command such that the values are in km/h. To that end, you have to divide air time by 60 and multiply distance by a certain factor. Look up the factor. Be careful with the order of mathematical operations and maybe use brackets (). Test your computation. Are the speed values reasonable?\nNow, make a histogram of speed. Add another pipe after the select statement and write ggplot(mapping = aes()) in the next line. Note, that you should not put data = flights into the argument of ggplot()! It is the mission of the pipe to do this. Fill out the aes() command accordingly, and add the geom for a histogram.\n\nflights |> \n  mutate(speed = distance / air_time ) |> \n  select(air_time, distance, speed)\n\nPractice filter operations, which subsets certain observations of a dataframe. Write a line which filters the flights which\n\n\nhad an arrival delay of two or more hours\nflew to Houston (IAH or HOU)\narrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late\nstarted with a delay of at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight. Put all four lines into the chunk filtering.\n\n\nAnother common operation is summarizing data. Put the code below into the chunk summarizing and test it. You see the average delay at departure. (See ?mean to learn what na.rm = TRUE is doing). Now, we want to know the average delay at departue for each of the three airports of origin. This is done with a group_by applied to the flights. Find out how and modify the code in the chunk accordingly.\n\nflights |> \n  summarize(mean_dep_deplay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nFinally, look at the plot of airportlocations. The airport locations show the shape of the United States of America, but there are four airports on the right hand side which do not fit that pattern. Filter airports such that you only see these four airport. Write your solution into the chunk stangeairportlocations. Check with internet research where these airports are located. Why are the locations from the data as they are? List your hypotheses for each airport under the chunk."

    "text": "Read and do the homework in R first. There you find more instructions and exercises.\nYou can also copy each chunk into a notebook cell within jupyter notebook template file and work with the .ipynb file\nquarto can also render .ipynb files. (Actually quarto converts .qmd files into .ipynb files and renders them afterwards)\nThere is also a .ipynb Template in the python Codebase provided.\n\nThis analysis works with datasets in the package nycflights13 about flights, specifically a sample of domestic flights that departed from the three major New York City airport in 2013.\n\n1 Data overview\n#| label: packages-data\n#| message: false  # We do not want to see the common tidyverse message in our document\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom nycflights13 import flights, planes,airports\nRun the first chunk to import the packages, by running the command as:\n\nfrom nycflights import …\n\nYou can deliberately choose which dataset you want to import from nycflights13. The nameing convension seems to be identical with the dataset in R.\n#| output: false\nflights.info()\nExplore the datasets. If you are running the code in VSCode you can see the variable in the “JUPYTER: VARIABLES” window. Write flights.info() in the Console or in a chunk and remove it afterwards to see an overview of all variables, their types. (Write a short note about the differences to the R glimpse command)\n\n\n2 Whats the differences between R:glimpse and pandas:info\n…\n\n\n3 Data visualization\n\nWe first want to know the distribution of values of the categorical variable origin in flights. To that end, make a bar chart. Use the seaborn command displot.\n\n\nsns.displot(data=flights,x = .. y= ..,height=.., aspect=..)\ngeom_bar or geom_col is just a variation between the usage of variable x and y. Use height=.., aspect=.. to adjust the size of the plot.\n\nNow, we want to know the distribution of values of the numerical variable distance in flights. A common visualization is a histogram. Use sns.histplot with the same template, write the solution in the chunk flightsdistance, and test it. The command binwidth is equivalent to bin-width in R. Use it inside the seaborn function.\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,6)) is used to vary the size of the plot.\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,6))\nsns.histplot(data=flights,x='distance',ax=ax, ...)\nIn chunk distributions you see two ways to visualize the distribution of the number of seats in airplanes - points for each observation and a boxplot. Different to ggplot you define the output first. With ncols= .. ,nrows =.. you specify the layout and access it with  ax  similar to an array.\n#| label: distributions\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=3,figsize=(8,6))\n#fig,[ax1,ax2,ax3] = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=3,figsize=(24,12)) ## Or define the array elements\nax[0].plot(np.zeros(len(planes)),planes['seats'],'k.')\nsns.boxplot(data=planes,y='seats',\n    boxprops={'facecolor':'None'},\n    ax=ax[1])\n#sns.boxplot(data=planes\n    #boxprops={'facecolor':'None'},\n    #ax=..)\n    # )\nNow, we make the first plot in python which visualizes two variables, the categorical variable engine, and the numerical variable seats in airplanes\n#| label: engine-seats\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(24,12))\n\nsns.boxplot(data=planes,x = .. , y = ..\n    boxprops={'facecolor':'None'},\n    ax=ax)\nSo, do not use flights in data = .. but a random sample of 10,000 flights flights.sample(n=10000). To visualize a scatterplot use sns.scatterplot(). To add an information about the categorical variable origin and assign it to the color aesthetica variation, include  ..,hue= .. , in the scatterplot command.\n#| label: delays\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,10))\nsns.scatterplot(data= flights.., x='dep_delay',y='arr_delay',..,ax=ax)\nFinally, let us visualize the location of airports as points at their longitude and latitude (look up the variable names) and color them with the timezone tzone they are in. Put the solution into the chunk airportlocations.\n#| label: airportlocations\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,10))\nsns.scatterplot()\n\n\n4 Data Wrangling\nIn the following, you have to solve some data wrangling tasks. For data wrangling, you use different commands onto a DataFrame devided by a “.” . There is not equivalent to “pipes” in the pandas or python programming language. Here the easiest way is to creat a new column in our DataFrame with the average speed in it. The pandas specific .div() command allows for a fast division of two columns. Also modify the equation such that the values are in km/h.\n#| label: flightsaveragespeed\nflights['speed'] = flights['distance'].div(flights['air_time'])\nThe filter function is not available in python. IMHO the .loc function is the most comprehensive function the filter a DataFrame by using logical expressions.\nPractice .loc operations, which subsets certain observations of a dataframe. Write a line which filters the flights which\n\nhad an arrival delay of two or more hours\nflew to Houston (IAH or HOU)\narrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late\nstarted with a delay of at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight.\n\nuse individual lines for each filter. In the end use .describe() on the flights DataFrame. Now, we want to know the average delay at departue for each of the three airports of origin. This is done with a groupby(..) applied to the filtered DataFrame. additionally apply mean() and select the correct column. Find out how and modify the code in the chunk accordingly.\n#| label: flightsaveragespeed\nflights = flights.loc[flights['arr_delay']>=120] # 120 minutes\nNOTE: If you do not choose a new variable name for the DataFrame, data is lost, until you reload the complete DataFrame\nFinally, look at the plot of airportlocations. The airport locations show the shape of the United States of America, but there are four airports on the right hand side which do not fit that pattern. Filter airports such that you only see these four airport. Write your solution into the chunk stangeairportlocations. Check with internet research where these airports are located. Why are the locations from the data as they are? List your hypotheses for each airport under the chunk.\n#| label: strangeairportlocations\nplt.figure(figsize=(20,6))\nplt.plot( airports[..],airports[..] ,'.')"

E.g, planes$tailnum in planes.\nA foreign key uniquely identifies an observation in another data frame E.g. flights$tailnum is a foreign key in flights because it matches each flight to a unique plane in planes.\nData frames need not have a key and the joins will still do their work.\nA primary key and a foreign key form a relation.\nRelations are typically 1-to-many. Each plane has many flights\nRelations can also be many-to-many. Airlines can fly to many airports; airport can host many airplanes."

    "text": "1 Corona\nContinue to work on your repository corona-ind-USERNAME and make the analysis in R-chunks.\nCreate a new Quarto-document and save it as “Corona_Analysis.qmd”.\n\nCustomize the YAML with the title “Corona Analysis”, your name, and output format being a standalone html-file with embedded resources. Enable code-folding in the output html file.\nWrite a chunk labeled data where you load the tidyverse library and import the data from Our World in Data (OWiD) into a tibble owid and the data from the World Health Organization (WHO) into a tibble called who (use read_csv for both).\nDocument what you did: Write a headline ## Data before the chunk data and briefly describe the two data sources and link the data files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nIn https://github.com/JU-F22-MDSSB-MET-01/corona-ind-janlorenz/blob/main/Download_corona_data.R you find a script which downloads the corona datasets from OWiD and WHO. You can copy this.\nIn https://github.com/JU-F22-MDSSB-MET-01/corona-ind-janlorenz/blob/main/Corona.qmd you find an example for the YAML and the data import chunk.\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Question 1: Is the data of OWiD and WHO the same?\nWrite a new headline ## Differences between OWiD and WHO data, make the following analysis in a chunk, and write an answer to the question. Guide for the analysis:\n\nCreate a joined tibble. This can be done with a chain of pipes |>.\n\nMake a new tibble who_owid where you left join owid to who. Use the combination of the data and the country as the key. To that end you have to identify the corresponding columns in who and owid with the named vector c(\"Date_reported\" = \"date\", \"Country\" = \"location\").\nUse select to select and rename columns in who_owid such that you have columns for Date, Country, New_cases_who, New_cases_owid, Total_cases_who, and Total_cases_owid.\n\nMake a visualization where the new cases in WHO and OWiD appear as two lines. Filter for the time before 2020-07-01 and four countries: Germany, France, India, and a country of your choice (Hint: use %in%). Then facet your visualization by country.\nRepeat the visualization for the comparison of WHO and OWiD data for the total cases.\nBelow the visualizations, explain what is visualizaed and then answer the question based on the visualizations. (Some guiding questions: What are the differences? How severe are the differences on a daily basis and in the long run? What data shows more fluctuations?) Bonus: What is the reason for the difference?\n\n\nFor comparing New_cases_who and New_cases_owid you need a to make the tibble longer (pivot_longer) such that you have one column with a categroical variable specifying the data source and one column with the actual value of the new cases in each data set. Then you can make a ggplot with geom_line where you make two lines by assigning the data source to the color aesthetic.\nFor faceting, use facet_wrap. It is useful to specify that there should be only one column and that scales are specified such that each facet has its own y-axis scale (called free_y).\nThe same advice holds for the visualization of total cases.\n\n\n\n1.2 Question 2: Are there patterns in the timeline of new cases which seem unrelated to the potential spread of the virus in the population? How could we smooth them best?\nWrite a new headline ## Smoothing new cases, make a chunk where you compute three additional columns with smoothed case numbers (see below), make a visualization and explain which is most appropriate to use and why.\n\nComputed a new tibble who_smoothed from who for this question. (There would be no essential difference with owid.) For each day compute the average of the actual day and some days directly before such that each new value is an average of 3, 7, or 10 days. Call the three new columns New_cases_smooth3, New_cases_smooth7, and New_cases_smooth10. The average is the sum of all values divided by the total number of days. Use mutate. For each column use lag several times for each previous day (see ?lag). Don’t forget to group by countries!\nVisualize the timeline for Germany using a time span between 6 and 12 month. Make one panel for New_cases_smooth3, New_cases_smooth7, and New_cases_smooth10 respectively. (Hint: Either use pivot_longer and faceting, or three ggplot objects combined using the package patchwork.)\nAnswer the question. What is the pattern which seems unrelated to the spread of the virus? Which is the most appropriate smoothing, 3, 7, or 10 days and why?\n\n\n\n1.3 Question 3: How do deaths follow cases?\nMake a new headline about this question in your report.\nIn owid, there are variables new_cases_smoothed and new_deaths_smoothed which you can use for convenience to explore this question.\nTo explore the connection between COVID-19 cases and deaths focus on the first wave in Germany. In owid, filter the data for Germany and dates before 2020-07-01. Plot new_cases_smoothed and new_deaths_smoothed in one line plot using color to distinguish both. (Hint: Use pivot_longer.) Now, produce a new variable scaled_lagged_cases where you do a shift-and-scale transformation of new_cases_smoothed: That means you scale down the number of cases by multiplying a factor \\(y\\)(< 1) and you lag the number of cases along the time axis by \\(x\\) days using y * lag(new_cases_smoothed, x).\n\nPlay with numerical values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) by plotting scaled_lagged_cases together with new_death_smoothed. Find values for such that both lines overlap as good as possible. Put this visualization into the report.\nDescribe what these “visually calibrated” values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) tell us about the relation of cases and deaths of COVID-19?\nRedo the line plot with your calibrated values for all dates in Germany. Describe how the connection between new cases and deaths changes in the course of the pandemic. List potential reasons.\nRepeat this analysis for another country of your choice. To that end find out the time range of the first wave in the country before. Do you get the same \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) by visually calibrating for this country?\n\n\n\n1.4 Question 4: How is the severity of the corona pandemic in countries related to human development?\nMake a new headline about this question in your report.\nHuman development is meant to be measured by the human development index of the United Nations Development Programme. Briefly, describe in the report how the Human Development Index (HDI) is composed.\nUse owid. Make a figure which visualizes each country as a point with human_development_index on the horizontal and total_deaths_per_million on the vertical axis. Filter the values for the date 2022-08-31. Filter out all rows which do not represent countries. (Hint: You can take all rows which have a valid value for continent.) Make the size of dots such that the area is proportional to the population. (Hint: Use the scale_size_area() as an additional layer.) Color the dots by continent.\nDescribe the visible relation of HDI and total corona related deaths per million. Emphasize what you find interesting, and hypothesize about potential reasons for the finding.\n\n\n1.5 Submit your report\nMake sure that your rendered html file reads nicely as a report. Polish the formatting if necessary. Commit your qmd-file and the rendered html-file and push it to GitHub."

Enable code-folding in the output html file.\nWrite a chunk labeled data where you load the tidyverse library and import the dataset you downloaded for Homework 02.\n\nDocument what you did: Write a headline ## Data before the chunk data and briefly describe the data source.\nFor each of the following questions write a fitting headline to structure your report.\n\n\n2.1 Question 1: What is the ranking of European countries with respect to of average satisfaction with life?\n\nCompute the average of stflife for each country-year combination. Make a table with four columns: the country name and the average life satisfaction for the years 2006, 2012, and 2018. Order the table by the values in 2018 and print it nicely in your report.\nTo that end, you must create new variables countryname from the two-character ISO-codes in cntyr (use the library pycountry) and a new variable year.\nBeware: The ESS variables have coded missing values as large numbers like 77 or 88. Find out these values and recode them as NA before computing averages!\n\nDescribe what you find remarkable in the table. (Who is on top? who at the bottom? Any interesting trends? Any geographical patterns?)\n\n\n\n2.2 Question 2: What is the relation of the emotional attachment of Europeans to their own country and to Europe?\nEmotional attachment to Europe may diminish emotional attachment to the country. Test if this is true with the variables atchctr and atcherp. First, look up the wording of the two questions and the answering options and write it into the report.\nBuild two visualizations and put them in the report. Beware: First recode the missing values as NA! (See above.)\n\nA visualization where you first count the number of individuals each combination of valid values of atchctr and atcherp. Then plot each combination as a dot with atchctr on the x-axis, atcherp on the y-axis, and the number of individuals represented by size and color and color of the dot.\nMake a lowess (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) line of atchctr on the x-axis, atcherp on the y-axis using the function regplot from seaborn.\n\nAnswer the question based on the visualization.\n\n\n2.3 Question 3: What is the relation of the emotional attachment to the own country and the opinion about further of European integration?\nThis is analog to Question 2 with euftf instead of atcherp. First, look up the wording of euftf and the answering options and write it into the report. Beware: First recode the missing values as NA! (See above.)\nBuild two visualizations as above.\nAnswer the question.\n\n\n2.4 Question 4: How many observations are there for each country-year combination?\nCompute the numbers and list them nicely in a table in your report.\nAre the numbers roughly proportional to the population in these countries? Discuss if the answer creates some shortcomings about the answers to Questions 2 and 3. How could these be mitigated?\n\n\n2.5 Question 5: Answer your own exploratory question\nLook up questions behind the variables in the ESS data set, formulate a question, and answer it with summarizing, and visualization."

This is maybe a good model to detect and memorize shapes, but it has nothing to do with these animals.\nEvery model is a simplification of the real world, but there are good and bad models (for particular purposes).\nA skeptical (but constructive) approach to a model is always advisable."
