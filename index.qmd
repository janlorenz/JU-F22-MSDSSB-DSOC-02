# Modules Data Science Concepts / Methods

These two modules are orchestrated in close cooperation

* Data Science Concepts (Core module: MSDSSB-DSOC-02)
* Data Science Tools (Methods module: MDSSB-MET-01)

You should know how the courses are integrated in the overall [Master program](https://www.jacobs-university.de/study/graduate/programs/data-science-society-and-business) and the module descriptions from the [DSSB Handbook](  https://www.jacobs-university.de/sites/default/files/dssb_master_handbook_2021.pdf). 

Our main goal in the two modules are that you: 

* create and maintain a digital working environment on your computer to do data science
* learn to program in the data science languages R and python, and become able to learn new skills in these independently
* learn core concepts in data science
  * learning and refreshing some *mathematics* and *statistics* through the data science lens
  * learn to explore data
  * learn 
* do a full data science project of your onw interest

# Infrastructure

**Computers**

# Online Infrastructure

**Campusnet:** https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de\
This is the official registration site. Besides the final grade input for the modules we will not use it in the courses.

**jMoodle:** https://elearning.jacobs-university.de\
The course's identifiers are .... We use a forum for asynchronous answering and advising for technical questions and issues with software and digital infrastructure. We may occasionally use some other functions of Moodle.

**Microsoft Teams:** In MS Teams there is a Team for the course "S22_MDSSB-SOCB-02_Introduction to Computational Social Science". In class we can use a Teams meeting to show student screens on the projector without pulling cables.\
The "General" channel can be used for announcements. You also post there. You can also post to me directly over Teams.

**GitHub:** ... Github Link Github issues

# Software

In the course and in class we work with freely available software.

# Reading

R for data Science

## Week 1:


## Graded Projects

Data Science Questions in Week 3 or so. First teaser for student projects.

Good projects can be listed in Bremen Data Science Lab.
