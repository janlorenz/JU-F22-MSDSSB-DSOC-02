# Basic Information 

## Modules Data Science Concepts / Methods

These two modules are orchestrated in close cooperation

* Data Science Concepts (Core module: MSDSSB-DSOC-02)
* Data Science Tools (Methods module: MDSSB-MET-01)

You should know how the courses are integrated in the overall [Master program](https://www.jacobs-university.de/study/graduate/programs/data-science-society-and-business) and the module descriptions from the [DSSB Handbook](  https://www.jacobs-university.de/sites/default/files/dssb_master_handbook_2021.pdf). 

## Courses and Instructors

Thursday is the concepts and tools day!

**Data Science Tools in R:**	Thursday 9:45 - 11:00	[Armin Müller](https://www.jacobs-university.de/directory/armm%C3%BCller)   
**Data Science Tools in Python:** Thursday 11:15 - 12:30	[Martin Gestefeld](https://www.jacobs-university.de/directory/gestefeld)  
**Data Science Concepts Lectures:** Thursday 14:15 - 17:00 (2 Sessions) [Jan Lorenz](http://janlo.de)

## Goal 

Our goal in the two modules is to enable you to

* create and maintain a digital working environment on your computer to do data science
* learn core concepts in data science, that means
  * learn concepts to explore data (visualize, import, wrangle)
  * learn or refresh some *mathematics* and *statistics* concepts through the data science lens
  * learn concepts to model and draw conclusions from data (model, infer, predict)
* learn to program in the data science languages R and python, and become able to learn new skills in these independently
* do a data science project of your own interest

You can build a good basis for your more and more independent the work in the whole program. 


## Expectations for students

We rely on your **engagement**. Taken holistically, engagement is many-faceted and includes

* Preparation (looking at readings and material before class, being informed about syllabus and course material)
* Focus (avoid distraction during in class and online activities)
* Presence (listening and responding during group activities)
* Asking questions (in class, out of class, online, offline)
* Specificity (being specific when referring to ideas from readings and discussions)
* Synthesizing (making connections between concepts from reading and discussion)

## Online Infrastructure

[**Campusnet**](https://campusnet.jacobs-university.de)
This is the official registration site. Besides the final grade input for the modules we will *not use it* in the courses, but you should be able to get back to this site from there once you are lost. 

[**jMoodle**](https://elearning.jacobs-university.de) 
An e-learning platform provided by Jacobs University. Log in with your campusnet credentials. 
Under the Data Science Concepts Course (identifier MDSSB-DSOC-02_f2022_1) we publish information (e.g. survey links) which shall be shared only among participants of the course. (After all this is a public website, although it is not intended to be announced publicly.)

::: callout-important
Test to log in and visit the *Data Science Concepts* course on [*jMoodle*](https://elearning.jacobs-university.de). **Be prepared to go there during class!**
:::

**Microsoft Teams:** In MS Teams there is a Team for the course. Teams will be used for hybrid online and in class teaching. It is expected that you come to class in presence if possible. Participation should only be online when abroad or CoViD-isolated at home. The "General" channel can be used for announcements. You can also post there. You can also post to me directly over Teams and hope for a quick answer.

**GitHub:** All delivery and submission of homework is via Github. Details in the lecture slides of week 1 and "Homework 01" (on this page).  

## Software

We use a mandatory set of software. Details are in the slides of week 1. Our task with highest priority is to realize that everyone has full installation and functionality on their local machines. All software is freely available software.

## Grading

*This will be updated and made more specific later.*

**Data Science Concepts:** Grading is based on an exam of 120 minutes. 

**Data Science Tools:** Grading is based on team project of approximately 4000-5000 words. As a requirement, enough homework assignment tasks need to be correctly solved. These do not determine the grade, but can improve it. See handbook for details. 

# Learning Resources

Some week's lectures have readings to review before class. These shall come continuously updated in the schedule below. Check the schedule regularly. 

A large part of the course will build on or be inspired by material in **Data Science in the Box** <https://datasciencebox.org/> by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and the data science education community around. 
You can also use the website for accompanying self-study on selected topics. 

A core resource (for some readings) will be **R for Data Science** <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/> by Hadley Wickham and the R data science community around. This is a valuable resource for self-studying particular topics. 

**Data Visualization**

*ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis* <https://ggplot2-book.org> is a resource on understanding the logic of ggplot better. 

Websites on how to decide for what visualization to choose:   
<https://www.data-to-viz.com/>   
<https://datavizcatalogue.com/search.html>



*The number of freely available learning resources is increasing rapidly.* 

*Everyone has a different learning style and a different background. Thus, different material may be most helpful.*

*This list shall be extended. Good self-study resources for data science with python, mathematics, statistics, data visualization, etc. shall be added here. Contact me if you find something useful to share. Ideally, with a short description when it may be most helpful.*

# Course Material and Schedule
